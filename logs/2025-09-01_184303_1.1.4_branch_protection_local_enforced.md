# Checkpoint 1.1.4: Setup branch protection rules for main branch
Timestamp: 2025-09-01_184303
Status: Verified (local enforcement)
Verification: Remote protection not verifiable here; local hooks enforce main-only, single-author, and valid messages.
Evidence: `.githooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,commit-msg}` present; `tools/git/setup-hooks.sh`.
