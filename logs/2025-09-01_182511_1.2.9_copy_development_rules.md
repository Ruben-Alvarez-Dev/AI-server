# Checkpoint 1.2.9: Copy development standard documents to /docs/development
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-01_182511
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Commit**: Pending (local hook requires author identity)

## Completed
- Copied development rules into `docs/development/`:
  - `language_communication_rules.md`
  - `development_standards.md`
  - `commit_conventions.md`
- Source of truth remains in `logs/plan/01..03` per project organization.
- Verified directories structure for Chapter 1 tasks exists.

## Rules Applied
- Language rules (code/docs technical in English; user comms in Spanish) respected.
- Directory Rules: `logs/` and `plan/` tracked; `OLD_VERSION/` ignored.
- ATLAS black box preserved.

## Next Steps
- If desired, commit using `scripts/organic-commit.sh` after setting Git author to Ruben-Alvarez-Dev.

## Notes
- Chapter 1 item 1.1.4 (PR-based branch protection) conflicts with main-only strategy. Enforced locally via hooks (no PRs, direct main commits).
