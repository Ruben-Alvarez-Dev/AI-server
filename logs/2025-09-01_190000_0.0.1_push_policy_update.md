# Push Policy Update
Timestamp: 2025-09-01_190000
Status: Completed

Change:
- Updated workflow to always push to `origin/main` immediately after a successful commit when all rules are satisfied.
- `scripts/organic-commit.sh` now performs `git push origin main` automatically.
- Rules documents updated to reflect push as a mandatory workflow step.

Notes:
- Pre-push hook enforces single-author, linear history, and granularity.
