**19 tasks | Phase 4 | Prerequisites: Chapter 7 completed**

## 8.1 Memory-LLM Communication (6 tasks)

- [ ] **8.1.1 Configure Pulsar topics**  
  Create Pulsar topics for context-request, context-response, embedding-request, and storage-request. Set retention and partitioning. This establishes communication channels.

- [ ] **8.1.2 Define Avro schemas**  
  Create Avro schemas for all message types with versioning and compatibility rules. Include evolution strategy. This ensures message compatibility.

- [ ] **8.1.3 Implement request/response patterns**  
  Build request/response correlation using message IDs and reply-to topics. Handle timeouts and retries. This enables synchronous-style communication.

- [ ] **8.1.4 Setup error handling**  
  Implement dead letter queues, retry logic with exponential backoff, and error reporting. Monitor failure rates. This provides resilience.

- [ ] **8.1.5 Configure retry policies**  
  Set up intelligent retry policies with backoff, max attempts, and circuit breaking per operation type. Prevent retry storms. This balances reliability with resource usage.

- [ ] **8.1.6 Test bidirectional communication**  
  Verify Memory Server and LLM Server can exchange messages reliably under load. Test failure scenarios. This ensures integration works.

## 8.2 Basic RAG Pipeline (6 tasks)

- [ ] **8.2.1 Implement vector search**  
  Build vector similarity search using Qdrant with configurable top-K and similarity threshold. Include metadata filtering. This provides core retrieval.

- [ ] **8.2.2 Create context retrieval**  
  Implement context assembly from retrieved chunks with deduplication and ranking. Respect context limits. This prepares context for LLM.

- [ ] **8.2.3 Setup query routing**  
  Build query analyzer that determines optimal retrieval strategy based on query characteristics. Use router model. This improves retrieval quality.

- [ ] **8.2.4 Implement result ranking**  
  Create re-ranking system using cross-encoder or LLM scoring for better relevance. Combine multiple signals. This improves result quality.

- [ ] **8.2.5 Add relevance filtering**  
  Filter out results below relevance threshold to avoid noisy context. Make threshold configurable. This ensures context quality.

- [ ] **8.2.6 Test RAG accuracy**  
  Evaluate RAG pipeline with test queries measuring precision, recall, and answer quality. Create benchmark suite. This validates retrieval effectiveness.

## 8.3 MCP Server Implementation (6 tasks)

- [ ] **8.3.1 Create MCP server structure**  
  Initialize MCP server following Model Context Protocol specification with proper manifest. Use stdio transport. This enables integration with MCP-compatible desktop clients.

- [ ] **8.3.2 Implement search_memory tool**  
  Build tool that searches Memory Server and returns relevant context formatted for the client. Include metadata. This provides memory access.

- [ ] **8.3.3 Implement store_context tool**  
  Create tool for storing important context back to Memory Server with appropriate metadata. Handle various formats. This enables memory creation.

- [ ] **8.3.4 Implement execute_task tool**  
  Build tool that sends tasks to LLM Server and returns results, handling streaming if needed. Include profile selection. This enables LLM orchestration.

- [ ] **8.3.5 Setup stdio transport**  
  Configure standard input/output transport for communication with MCP desktop clients. Handle binary data properly. This provides the communication channel.

- [ ] **8.3.6 Test with MCP client**  
  Verify MCP server appears in the desktop client and tools function correctly. Test all tool operations. This validates integration.

## 8.4 Benthos Pipelines (1 task)

- [ ] **8.4.1 Create ingestion pipelines**  
  Build Benthos pipelines for data ingestion from various sources to Memory Server. Include transformation and error handling.
