# Chapter 15: Security & Hardening
**18 tasks | Phase 7 | Prerequisites: Chapter 14 completed**

## 15.1 Authentication Implementation (6 tasks)

- [ ] **15.1.1 Implement JWT authentication**  
  Add JWT-based authentication with RS256 signing for security. Include refresh token flow. This provides secure authentication.

- [ ] **15.1.2 Setup refresh tokens**  
  Implement refresh token mechanism with secure storage and rotation. Prevent token replay attacks. This maintains sessions securely.

- [ ] **15.1.3 Create user management**  
  Build user management system with registration, password reset, and profile management. Hash passwords properly. This enables user administration.

- [ ] **15.1.4 Implement role-based access**  
  Create RBAC system with roles: viewer, operator, admin and granular permissions. Follow principle of least privilege. This controls access.

- [ ] **15.1.5 Setup session management**  
  Implement secure session management with timeout, concurrent session limits, and secure cookies. Prevent session fixation. This manages user sessions.

- [ ] **15.1.6 Test authentication flows**  
  Test all authentication flows including edge cases: expired tokens, concurrent login, password reset. Verify security. This ensures authentication works.

## 15.2 Security Hardening (6 tasks)

- [ ] **15.2.1 Implement rate limiting**  
  Add rate limiting to all API endpoints preventing abuse and DDoS. Use sliding windows. This prevents abuse.

- [ ] **15.2.2 Setup input validation**  
  Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization preventing injection attacks. Use schema validation. This prevents injection.

- [ ] **15.2.3 Configure CORS properly**  
  Setup CORS with specific allowed origins, methods, and headers. Never use wildcard in production. This prevents CSRF.

- [ ] **15.2.4 Implement CSRF protection**  
  Add CSRF tokens to all state-changing operations. Validate on every request. This prevents CSRF attacks.

- [ ] **15.2.5 Setup XSS prevention**  
  Implement Content Security Policy and output encoding preventing XSS attacks. Sanitize user content. This prevents XSS.

- [ ] **15.2.6 Enable HTTPS locally**  
  Setup self-signed certificates for local HTTPS enabling secure development. Document certificate generation. This enables encrypted communication.

## 15.3 Audit & Compliance (6 tasks)

- [ ] **15.3.1 Implement audit logging**  
  Log all security-relevant events: authentication, authorization, configuration changes. Include actor and timestamp. This provides audit trail.

- [ ] **15.3.2 Setup security monitoring**  
  Monitor for security events: failed logins, permission denials, suspicious patterns. Alert on anomalies. This detects attacks.

- [ ] **15.3.3 Create security policies**  
  Document security policies: password requirements, session timeout, data retention. Enforce technically. This establishes security standards.

- [ ] **15.3.4 Document security procedures**  
  Write procedures for incident response, vulnerability management, and security updates. Include contacts. This enables security operations.

- [ ] **15.3.5 Perform security review**  
  Conduct security review of code, configurations, and dependencies. Use automated scanning. This identifies vulnerabilities.

- [ ] **15.3.6 Test security measures**  
  Test security controls with penetration testing techniques. Verify defenses work. This validates security.
