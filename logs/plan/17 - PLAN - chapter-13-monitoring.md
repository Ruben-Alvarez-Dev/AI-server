# Chapter 13: Monitoring & Observability
**30 tasks | Phase 7 | Prerequisites: Chapter 12 completed**

## 13.1 Prometheus Setup (6 tasks)

- [ ] **13.1.1 Install Prometheus**  
  Install Prometheus using Homebrew or binary download, choosing appropriate version for ARM64. Configure storage location. This provides metrics infrastructure.

- [ ] **13.1.2 Configure scraping targets**  
  Setup prometheus.yml with scrape configurations for all services and their metrics endpoints. Set appropriate intervals. This collects metrics.

- [ ] **13.1.3 Setup retention policies**  
  Configure retention period balancing storage space with historical data needs. Use 30 days default. This manages storage.

- [ ] **13.1.4 Create recording rules**  
  Define recording rules for frequently-used complex queries improving query performance. Pre-calculate aggregates. This optimizes queries.

- [ ] **13.1.5 Configure alerting rules**  
  Create alert rules for critical conditions: high IPC, service down, high error rate. Include severity levels. This enables proactive response.

- [ ] **13.1.6 Test metrics collection**  
  Verify Prometheus successfully scrapes all targets and metrics are correctly stored. Check for gaps. This validates collection.

## 13.2 Metrics Implementation (5 tasks)

- [ ] **13.2.1 Implement Prometheus exporters**  
  Add Prometheus client libraries to all services exposing metrics in Prometheus format. Use standard ports. This enables scraping.

- [ ] **13.2.2 Create custom metrics**  
  Define application-specific metrics: requests, latency, tokens processed, cache hits. Follow naming conventions. This provides visibility.

- [ ] **13.2.3 Setup metric aggregation**  
  Implement metric aggregation for high-cardinality data reducing storage requirements. Use histograms appropriately. This manages volume.

- [ ] **13.2.4 Implement metric persistence**  
  Configure Prometheus storage with appropriate retention and backup strategies. Consider remote storage. This preserves history.

- [ ] **13.2.5 Test metric accuracy**  
  Validate metrics accurately reflect system state by comparing with known values. Check for drift. This ensures reliability.

## 13.3 Grafana Dashboards (6 tasks)

- [ ] **13.3.1 Install Grafana**  
  Install Grafana via Homebrew or Docker, configuring for local access. Setup admin credentials. This provides visualization platform.

- [ ] **13.3.2 Configure data sources**  
  Add Prometheus as data source with appropriate URL and authentication. Test connectivity. This connects metrics.

- [ ] **13.3.3 Create system dashboard**  
  Build dashboard showing system metrics: CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, network. Include historical trends. This provides system overview.

- [ ] **13.3.4 Create service dashboards**  
  Create dedicated dashboards for Memory Server, LLM Server, and GUI Server with relevant metrics. Include SLIs. This enables service monitoring.

- [ ] **13.3.5 Setup alert panels**  
  Add alert visualization panels showing current alert status and history. Include acknowledgment. This surfaces issues.

- [ ] **13.3.6 Export dashboard templates**  
  Export dashboards as JSON for version control and sharing. Document dashboard usage. This enables dashboard management.

## 13.4 Logging Infrastructure (6 tasks)

- [ ] **13.4.1 Setup structured logging**  
  Configure all services to output JSON structured logs with consistent schema. Include trace IDs. This enables log analysis.

- [ ] **13.4.2 Configure log aggregation**  
  Setup log aggregation using Vector or Fluentd to centralize logs from all services. Parse and enrich logs. This centralizes logging.

- [ ] **13.4.3 Implement log rotation**  
  Configure log rotation with compression and retention policies preventing disk exhaustion. Keep 30 days. This manages log growth.

- [ ] **13.4.4 Setup log shipping**  
  Implement log shipping to centralized location or service for long-term storage. Consider compression. This preserves logs.

- [ ] **13.4.5 Create log analysis tools**  
  Build tools for log analysis: error extraction, performance analysis, pattern detection. Create useful queries. This enables troubleshooting.

- [ ] **13.4.6 Test log completeness**  
  Verify all important events are logged with appropriate detail and context. Check for missing logs. This ensures observability.

## 13.5 Distributed Tracing (5 tasks)

- [ ] **13.5.1 Implement OpenTelemetry**  
  Add OpenTelemetry libraries to all services for distributed tracing support. Configure exporters. This enables tracing.

- [ ] **13.5.2 Setup trace collection**  
  Deploy Jaeger or similar for trace collection and storage. Configure sampling rates. This collects traces.

- [ ] **13.5.3 Configure sampling**  
  Implement intelligent sampling: 100% for errors, 10% for normal traffic. Adjust based on volume. This balances detail with overhead.

- [ ] **13.5.4 Create trace visualization**  
  Setup Jaeger UI or similar for trace visualization and analysis. Configure retention. This enables trace analysis.

- [ ] **13.5.5 Test trace accuracy**  
  Verify traces accurately represent request flow through system. Check for missing spans. This validates tracing.

## 13.6 Alerting System (2 tasks)

- [ ] **13.6.1 Setup alert manager**  
  Configure Prometheus Alertmanager for alert routing, grouping, and silencing. This manages alerts.

- [ ] **13.6.2 Configure notifications**  
  Setup notification channels: email, Slack, webhook for different severity levels. This ensures visibility.
