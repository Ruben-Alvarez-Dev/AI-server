# Chapter 14: Testing & Quality
**24 tasks | Phase 7 | Prerequisites: Chapter 13 completed**

## 14.1 Unit Testing (6 tasks)

- [ ] **14.1.1 Setup pytest framework**  
  Configure pytest with appropriate plugins for coverage, parallel execution, and reporting. Create pytest.ini. This provides test infrastructure.

- [ ] **14.1.2 Write Memory Server tests**  
  Create comprehensive unit tests for Memory Server components: hierarchy, cleanup, storage. Mock external dependencies. This ensures Memory Server quality.

- [ ] **14.1.3 Write LLM Server tests**  
  Build tests for LLM Server: orchestration, profile management, model loading. Mock model inference. This validates LLM Server.

- [ ] **14.1.4 Write service tests**  
  Test shared services: messaging, storage, embeddings with appropriate mocks and fixtures. Cover edge cases. This ensures service reliability.

- [ ] **14.1.5 Achieve 80% coverage**  
  Write tests to achieve minimum 80% code coverage focusing on critical paths. Exclude generated code. This provides confidence.

- [ ] **14.1.6 Setup coverage reporting**  
  Configure coverage.py with HTML reports and CI integration. Track coverage trends. This monitors test completeness.

## 14.2 Integration Testing (6 tasks)

- [ ] **14.2.1 Create integration test suite**  
  Build test suite that verifies component interactions using real services where possible. Use Docker for isolation. This tests integration.

- [ ] **14.2.2 Test Memory-LLM communication**  
  Verify Memory Server and LLM Server communicate correctly via Pulsar. Test various message patterns. This ensures integration works.

- [ ] **14.2.3 Test RAG pipeline**  
  Test end-to-end RAG pipeline from ingestion through retrieval to generation. Measure quality metrics. This validates RAG.

- [ ] **14.2.4 Test profile switching**  
  Verify profile switching works correctly under various conditions including under load. Time transitions. This ensures switching works.

- [ ] **14.2.5 Test cleanup procedures**  
  Test cleanup procedures trigger correctly and effectively free resources. Simulate high pressure. This validates cleanup.

- [ ] **14.2.6 Verify end-to-end flows**  
  Test complete user workflows from API through to response. Include error scenarios. This ensures system coherence.

## 14.3 Performance Testing (6 tasks)

- [ ] **14.3.1 Create benchmark suite**  
  Build comprehensive benchmark suite testing individual components and full system. Automate execution. This measures performance.

- [ ] **14.3.2 Test ingestion throughput**  
  Benchmark document ingestion measuring documents/second and MB/second. Find bottlenecks. This validates ingestion capacity.

- [ ] **14.3.3 Test query latency**  
  Measure query latencies at various percentiles (P50, P95, P99) under different loads. Set SLOs. This ensures responsiveness.

- [ ] **14.3.4 Test model inference speed**  
  Benchmark model inference speeds in tokens/second for each model and quantization. Compare with specs. This validates model performance.

- [ ] **14.3.5 Test concurrent users**  
  Test system with multiple concurrent users measuring response degradation. Find scaling limits. This determines capacity.

- [ ] **14.3.6 Document performance baselines**  
  Document all performance measurements as baselines for regression detection. Include test conditions. This enables performance tracking.

## 14.4 Load Testing (6 tasks)

- [ ] **14.4.1 Setup load testing tools**  
  Install and configure load testing tools like Locust or K6 for realistic load generation. Create test scenarios. This enables load testing.

- [ ] **14.4.2 Create load scenarios**  
  Define realistic load scenarios: normal, peak, and stress conditions. Include think time. This simulates real usage.

- [ ] **14.4.3 Test system limits**  
  Gradually increase load until system fails identifying breaking points. Monitor all metrics. This finds limits.

- [ ] **14.4.4 Identify bottlenecks**  
  Analyze metrics during load tests to identify bottlenecks: CPU, memory, I/O, or network. Profile hot paths. This guides optimization.

- [ ] **14.4.5 Verify auto-scaling**  
  Test that auto-scaling mechanisms (cleanup, cache eviction) activate appropriately under load. Verify effectiveness. This ensures adaptability.

- [ ] **14.4.6 Document capacity**  
  Document system capacity in terms of concurrent users, requests/second, and resource usage. Include growth projections. This informs deployment.
