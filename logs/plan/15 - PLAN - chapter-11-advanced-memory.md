## 11.1 Hierarchy Levels L3-L5 (6 tasks)

- [ ] **11.1.1 Implement L3 graph structures**  
  Build knowledge graph layer using Neo4j to store entities and relationships extracted from L2. Use NLP for extraction. This creates structured knowledge.

- [ ] **11.1.2 Create L4 pattern extraction**  
  Implement pattern mining that identifies recurring patterns, principles, and practices from L3 graph. Use frequency analysis. This distills patterns.

- [ ] **11.1.3 Implement L5 axiom distillation**  
  Create axiom extraction that identifies fundamental truths and core principles from patterns. These never expire. This preserves essential knowledge.

- [ ] **11.1.4 Setup inter-level relationships**  
  Build bidirectional links between hierarchy levels for navigation and provenance tracking. Maintain consistency. This enables hierarchy traversal.

- [ ] **11.1.5 Configure compression ratios**  
  Set and verify compression ratios: L3=200:1, L4=1000:1, L5=5000:1 from L0. Monitor actual ratios. This ensures efficient storage.

- [ ] **11.1.6 Test hierarchy completeness**  
  Verify data flows correctly through all levels with appropriate transformation and compression. Test with various content. This validates the hierarchy.

## 11.2 Graph Storage (6 tasks)
