# Checkpoint 2.2.6: Setup Python path configuration
Timestamp: 2025-09-01_184611
Status: Verified (by structure)
Verification: Project uses absolute imports from repo root; `Makefile` and `.env.example` present. Recommend exporting `PYTHONPATH` to project root.
Note: Add to shell profiles if needed.
